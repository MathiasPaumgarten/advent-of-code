# Solutions to [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)

> Some Christmas Fun

## What is it

[Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a wonderful little coding challenge,
with a new challenge every day for all of the advent made by [@topaz](https://github.com/topaz).

I'm posting my answers here, in case anybody is stuck and wants to look into a solution.

Some of my answers might not have the optimal performance but I wanted to keep
the code readable rather than compact and fast.

## Thank you

Big thanks to Eric Wastl ([@ericwastl on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)) for putting that together.


## Run the code

If you want to run my solutions, you can go into each directory and simply run
`node <filename>` such as `node part-1.js` or `node day-1/part-1.js`. Since none of them
have any dependencies (thus far).
